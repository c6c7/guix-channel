    (description "Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed
with the following principles in mind:

@itemize
@item Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you
might be tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, so
that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore it.  Likewise,
restoring data should not be complicated.

@item Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
Nobody does backups if it takes too much time.  Restoring backups should only
transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so that
this process is also fast.

@item Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic
enables you to easily verify that all data can be restored.  @item Secure:
Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of your
data.  The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to be a trusted
environment (e.g.  a shared space where others like system administrators are
able to access your backups).  Restic is built to secure your data against
such attackers.

@item Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only
take the storage of the actual increment.  Even more, duplicate data should be
de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end to save
precious backup space.
